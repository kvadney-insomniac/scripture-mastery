# Scripture Mastery

A whole-Bible survey trainer: learn what happens in each of the 66 books, who is
in them, where and when, until you could pass a Bible survey quiz on all of it.
It was first built for one church's survey quiz.

**Try it: https://kvadney-insomniac.github.io/scripture-mastery/** No sign-up and
nothing to install; this public build keeps your progress in your own browser.

**6,581 questions** generated from structured data: 66 books with a full outline
and episode list each, 595 dated events, 360 per-book figures, 233 people, 54
places, 246 key terms, 14 historical eras, 13 standing lists, and 13 must-know
lists holding 145 cue/content pairs.

Every book carries its own outline, its episodes chapter by chapter with the
people in them, the terms it runs on, the numbers it is known for, and a line on
how it points to Christ. That is where the depth lives — roughly a hundred
questions per book, rather than thirty.

```bash
npm install
npm run dev      # http://localhost:5173
npm run build    # static output in dist/ — deployable anywhere
npm run validate # content-integrity checks over the whole item bank
npm run test:e2e # Playwright: 82 browser tests over the real UI
```

Two builds come from this code. The public one (`npm run build:solo`, what the
link above serves) has no account and stores progress in the browser. The
original team build syncs progress to Firestore behind a Google sign-in limited
to one church's accounts; see [Data & sync](#data--sync).

## Who it is for

- **Anyone preparing for a Bible survey quiz or class** who wants to know the
  whole Bible at the level of books, people, places, events and eras.
- **People who want the big picture** of how the story of the Bible fits
  together, one short question at a time, reviewed before they forget it.
- It works best on a computer. A phone is shown a short note first and can
  continue.

## What it does not do

- **It does not teach doctrine or interpretation.** It drills facts a survey
  course covers. The one line per book on how it points to Christ is the kind of
  summary a survey course gives, not the last word; read the book itself, and
  ask your pastor and the people you study with.
- **Its dates and authorship follow one common, conservative survey reading.**
  Where scholars differ, the explanation after an answer says so, but not every
  view is given.
- **It quotes short phrases, not whole passages.** Every key verse and landmark
  verse is the Berean Standard Bible's own words at the reference given, and
  `npm run validate` fails the build if one is not. Some short phrases inside
  the summaries still follow other wording and are being moved to the BSB. If
  you memorize from another translation, the wording here will differ.
- **It keeps your progress only in this browser** (public build). Clearing site
  data or switching device starts over; Progress has export and import.
- **It is not a substitute for reading the Bible.**

## Data & sync

Sign-in is Google only, gated to `acts2.network` and `gpmail.org` accounts. Each
user's `cards`/`settings`/`log`/`starred` blob lives in a single Firestore
document at `users/{uid}`, live-synced with `onSnapshot` so multiple tabs and
devices stay current, and cached locally (`persistentLocalCache`) so the app
still works offline and flushes pending writes when the connection returns.

The domain allowlist is enforced twice — once client-side for a fast UX bounce
(`src/lib/firebase.ts`), and once in `firestore.rules`, which is the copy that
actually matters since the client check can't be trusted on its own.

**First-time project setup**, beyond `npm install`:

1. In the Firebase console for the project, under **Authentication → Sign-in
   method**, enable the **Google** provider.
2. Deploy `firestore.rules` (`firebase deploy --only firestore:rules`, or paste
   its contents into **Firestore → Rules** in the console).
3. Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and fill in the web app config from
   **Project settings → General → Your apps**.

Export/import (**Progress → Your data**) still round-trips the whole store as a
JSON file — handy as a manual backup or for moving data outside the two
allowed domains.

---

## Why it works this way

Four findings drove the design. Sources are listed at the bottom.

**Retrieval beats re-reading.** Dunlosky et al.'s review of ten study techniques
rated only two as "high utility": practice testing and distributed practice.
Re-reading a book summary feels productive and mostly isn't. So the app is a
question engine first and a reference second.

**Spacing beats cramming.** Reviews are scheduled at expanding intervals — the
core of the Leitner system and SM-2. Miss a card and it comes back in a minute;
know it and it goes to the back of the line.

**Short and often beats long and rare.** Bible quiz coaches converge on this
independently of the psychology literature: "three 10-minute sessions during the
day work a lot better than" one long block. The dashboard prescribes a
three-session daily rhythm rather than a session count.

**Mixing beats blocking.** The review queue interleaves by topic, so you're not
answering six Genesis questions in a row. It feels harder and teaches more.

### The one deliberate deviation from SM-2

Standard SM-2 will happily schedule a well-known card 60 days out. If the quiz is
in 40 days, that card is now untested at exam time. So intervals are clamped to
half the time remaining:

```ts
const daysLeft = Math.max(0, Math.ceil((examDate - now) / DAY));
if (daysLeft > 0) interval = Math.min(interval, Math.max(1, Math.floor(daysLeft / 2)));
```

Every card gets at least one more look before the test. As October 31 approaches,
intervals compress automatically and the whole deck converges into daily review.
Change the date in **Progress → Settings** and the schedule re-plans itself.

## The five tabs

| Tab | What it's for |
|---|---|
| **Dashboard** | Countdown, cards due, mastery, streak, and the current phase of the plan |
| **Daily Review** | The spaced-repetition queue. This is the main event — clear it daily |
| **Quiz** | Mixed testing under quiz conditions. Filter by scope, topic, single book, or weak spots |
| **Reference** | Every book opened to five panes — overview, outline, events, people, terms — plus the timeline, 233 people, 54 places, the must-know lists, and the standing lists |
| **Study Plan** | Week-by-week schedule from the day you started to your quiz date |
| **Progress** | Mastery by book, stuck items, settings, export/import |

**Keyboard:** `1`–`6` pick an option (hard offers six) · `Enter` submits or
advances · `1`/`2`/`3` grade Hard/Ok/Easy after a correct answer.

---

## The study plan

Five phases, weighted and laid onto the actual calendar between the day you
started and your quiz date. The order is the point — the frame comes first
because every later fact needs somewhere to attach.

The plan is not just a reading: with **Follow the study plan** on (the default),
your daily review is drawn from whichever phase you are currently in, and the
Quiz offers *This week's plan* as a scope. When a phase runs dry the queue
widens to the rest of the bank rather than telling you there is nothing to
study, and **Study everything instead** sets it aside for a single session.

1. **Build the Frame** — all 66 books: order, division, author, one-line summary, outline
2. **Old Testament Sweep** — outline, key chapters, people and their families, events,
   places, and the terms each book runs on, book by book
3. **New Testament Sweep** — Gospels, Acts, every letter's audience and occasion, Revelation
4. **Timeline & Connections** — the 14 eras, the must-know and standing lists, the
   two fall dates, and how each book points to Christ
5. **Mixed Review & Mock Quizzes** — no new material, weak spots only

---

## Difficulty

The setting in **Settings → Difficulty** changes four things at once. It never
changes which questions exist — item ids are what review history is keyed on,
so the bank is generated once and the setting only decides what reaches the
card and which cards reach you.

| | Easy | Medium | Hard |
|---|---|---|---|
| Options offered | 3 | 4 | 6 |
| Wrong options drawn from | anywhere in the canon | books near the answer's own, never across the Testament seam | as close as the question allows — the same book, canonical neighbours, the same era or family |
| A reference answer | shown as choices | named from memory first | named from memory first, no hint |
| Hint before answering | yes | no | no |
| New material | walks the canon in order | interleaved by book | anywhere in scope, unpredictable, half again as much |
| A card you miss | comes back this session | comes back this session | comes back tomorrow |

Book Order questions are deliberately exempt from the Testament rule — "which
book immediately follows Malachi?" has a New Testament answer, so fencing it by
Testament would give the answer away. They are scoped by canonical distance
instead.

## How the question bank is built

Questions are **generated from structured data**, not hand-written. Correcting a
fact corrects it everywhere at once, and adding a fact adds questions everywhere
at once.

The content sits in two layers.

**The frame** (`books.ts`) is what gets you through the first round of a survey
quiz: order, division, author, chapter count, one-line summary, theme, key
chapters, memory hook.

**The detail** (`details/`) is the second round. Each of the 66 books has its own
entry carrying:

| Field | What it holds | Questions it generates |
|---|---|---|
| `outline` | The book's movements by chapter range | What do chapters 12–25 cover · which chapters cover this · put the movements in order |
| `events` | Every episode with its reference, participants, place, and the detail that separates it from anything similar | What happens at Genesis 22 · where does this happen · who is involved · which book records it · put these in order |
| `figures` | Each person's role *in this book* | What does Joab do in 2 Samuel · who is this, in 2 Samuel |
| `terms` | The vocabulary the book runs on | What does "propitiation" mean · which term is this |
| `numbers` | The figures the book is known for | How many Assyrians died in one night |
| `audience`, `purpose`, `written`, `writtenFrom` | Occasion and setting | Why was Galatians written · who to · from where |
| `christ` | How the book points to Christ | One per book |
| `distinctive` | What makes it unlike any other book | Which book is this true of |

A book's `figures` list is deliberately separate from the global `PEOPLE` roster.
Peter appears in six books doing six different things; "what does Peter do in
Acts 12" is a real question and "which book is Peter in" is not.

### Item ids are stable on purpose

Every generated item has a deterministic id (`gen-author-genesis`,
`gen-chapter-exodus-20`). Distractors are picked with a seeded PRNG keyed to that
id. **Editing a book's summary does not reset your review history** for unrelated
questions, and distractors don't reshuffle between sessions.

### Adding content

Add a `DetailEvent` and you get up to five questions: what happens there, where
it happens, who is involved, which book records it, and which detail belongs to
it. Add a `Figure` and you get two. Add a `Person` with a `father` and `tribe`
and you get five. Add an entry to `LISTS` plus matching `LIST_DECOYS` and you get
ordering, positional, and membership questions.

Roughly a hundred questions per book, without hand-writing any of them.

### Content-quality guards

`npm run validate` runs 21 checks over the generated bank and exits non-zero on
failure. Four of them exist because they caught real bugs.

**Distractors near the answer.** Chapter-count questions draw wrong options from
numerically adjacent books. Offering 50 against 3, 5, and 7 tests nothing;
offering 50 against 66, 36, and 40 tests something. Book-scoped questions draw
distractors from the same book first — knowing the cast of 2 Samuel is not the
same as knowing which of them killed Abner.

**No question with two right answers, across books.** The Transfiguration appears
in three Gospels, the Davidic covenant in both 2 Samuel and 1 Chronicles.
Generating "in which book does this occur?" naively produced 27 prompts where a
correct answer would have been marked wrong. The generator detects related event
phrasings by token overlap, emits one item per event, and excludes *every* book
recording it from the distractor pool.

**No question with two right answers, within a book.** Exodus 2 holds both the
basket in the Nile and the flight to Midian. "What happens in Exodus 2?" had two
correct answers, and because same-book distractors are drawn from the book's own
episodes, each was offered as a wrong option against the other. Prompts for a
shared chapter reference now name the episode.

**Hand-authored decoys where automatic ones lie.** Auto-drawing "which is NOT
part of X" decoys from other lists offered *Levi* as not-an-apostle — but Levi is
Matthew's other name. Those decoys live in `LIST_DECOYS` instead.

The ambiguity check itself needed care. Several cards legitimately share a prompt:
the four "which is NOT one of the Twelve Apostles" cards each pair a different
decoy with three real apostles, and every one of them has exactly one right
answer. Flagging shared prompts would have flagged those. The check that actually
means something is narrower — **one card's correct answer appearing as a wrong
option on another card asking the same question** — plus identical prompt *and*
identical option set with different answers. Both currently report zero.

### Browser tests

`npm run test:e2e` drives the actual app in Chromium — 82 tests over sign-in and
the domain gate, tab routing, all three question kinds, review sessions, quiz
filters, the reference search, and export/import/reset. A second project runs
the mobile refusal on an emulated Pixel 5, because the one thing that must never
happen on a phone is the app letting you in.

**Getting past Google sign-in.** Every screen but the splash sits behind a
Firebase popup, and the emulators need a JVM. So the E2E build swaps two modules
and nothing else: `src/lib/useStore.ts` and `src/lib/firebase.ts` are replaced by
`*.e2e.ts` stand-ins that keep the store in localStorage and make sign-in a
synchronous write. The swap lives in a vite plugin gated on `E2E=1`
(`vite.config.ts`), so a production build has never heard of it — `npm run build`
output contains zero E2E code and still ships the real Firebase SDK.

The point of that split is that the stand-in replaces the *transport only*.
Everything that decides what the store becomes when you answer a card lives in
`src/lib/store-ops.ts`, which both hooks call, so a browser test exercises the
real grading, logging and exam-clamp logic rather than a re-implementation of
it. The stand-in declares `StoreApi` as its return type: if the real hook's
surface changes, the fake stops compiling.

Tests seed a whole `Store` into localStorage before the app boots and read it
back afterwards (`tests/e2e/harness.ts`). Where a test needs a known question on
screen, it seeds one due card with `newLimit: 0` so the queue can only contain
that one — no shuffling, no flake. The three fixture item ids are pinned by
`content-contract.spec.ts`, so if the generator ever retires one, that says so
directly instead of a dozen UI tests failing for no visible reason.

**One known bug is recorded as a failing test.** `review.spec.ts` carries a
`test.fail()` for the requeue bug described below; delete the marker when it is
fixed and Playwright will flag the test as unexpectedly passing.

> Miss the last card of a session and it is requeued — but it comes back already
> answered, with the wrong answer still in a disabled input. The session card is
> keyed on `item.id` (`src/views/Review.tsx:127`), so when the same id repeats
> back to back React reuses the component and `QuestionCard`'s reset effect,
> keyed on that same id, never fires. You are never actually re-asked, which is
> the whole point of requeueing. Keying on the queue position fixes it.

## Content notes

- Authors follow the **traditional attribution** a survey quiz expects. Where
  scholarship differs, `authorNote` carries the nuance and surfaces in the
  explanation after you answer.
- Verse quotations are **BSB** (Berean Standard Bible, public domain since
  2023-04-30), kept short and used for identification rather than memorization.
  `npm run validate` holds each one to the BSB's own words at its reference,
  using `scripts/bsb-cited-verses.json` (written by `scripts/cite-bsb.ts`).
- Dates are approximate and follow common conservative dating. Chapter counts
  follow the English canon and total 1,189 (929 OT + 260 NT) — checked against
  those literal figures in `npm run validate`, not against themselves.
- **Composition dates and authorship** in the detail layer follow what a survey
  course teaches. Where the date is genuinely contested (Joel, Obadiah, Job) the
  entry says so rather than picking one silently.
- **Where a book's reading is disputed**, both readings are given as terms rather
  than one being asserted — Song of Solomon carries `Allegorical reading` and
  `Literal reading`; Revelation carries `Millennium` with the note that it is
  read three main ways.
- **The "Christ in this book" line** is one per book and is what a survey quiz
  asks for. It is a summary of the standard answer, not an argument for it.

## Tell us what helped

This is a small project, and it gets better when people say how it went.
Three questions, a minute or two:

1. What helped?
2. What did not work, or was confusing?
3. What would you want it to do?

Answer here: [the feedback form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc_3ztRXdPM8C7e8GCb43oO_2RcmQSij2pKcIkUSaSxtUhPfA/viewform)
(one form for several Bible tools; the first question asks which one), or open
an issue on this repository.

If you want help memorizing or studying, reach out through [the same form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc_3ztRXdPM8C7e8GCb43oO_2RcmQSij2pKcIkUSaSxtUhPfA/viewform);
it asks whether you would like help and leaves room for how to reach you.
