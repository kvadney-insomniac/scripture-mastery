/**
 * The model client the generator agent talks to, with a recorded-response
 * mode so the demo runs with no API key and gives the same answer twice.
 *
 * Two implementations behind one interface:
 *
 *   AnthropicLlm  real calls to the Claude API. Every response is written to
 *                 `hackathon/fixtures/llm/<hash>.json`, keyed by a hash of the
 *                 request, so a live run doubles as a recording session.
 *   ReplayLlm     serves those recordings back. No key, no network, no cost,
 *                 and deterministic, which is what you want when a demo is
 *                 being run in front of a room on conference wifi.
 *
 * `selectLlm()` picks replay unless credentials are present, so
 * `npm run hackathon:generate` works on a laptop that has never seen an
 * Anthropic key. Set LLM_MODE=live to force the real client (it will fail
 * loudly if there are no credentials) or LLM_MODE=replay to force replay.
 *
 * The SDK is imported dynamically on purpose. This directory is additive to
 * a fork of someone else's app, and the app's own build must not gain a
 * dependency it does not use. Replay needs no package at all; live mode asks
 * for `npm i @anthropic-ai/sdk` only when you actually reach for it.
