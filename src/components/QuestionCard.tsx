            "Correct" and "Not quite" arrived silently: the block is inserted
            after the answer is in, and an insertion is not a change any screen
            reader is watching for. `role="status"` is the polite kind — it
            waits for a gap rather than cutting across whatever is being read.

            Scoped to the verdict and the reason, with the grade buttons left
            outside it deliberately: they are the next thing to *do*, not part
            of the news, and an atomic region containing them would read out
            "Hard, see it more often, Ok, normal pace…" every time. It cannot
            fire twice per card either — the block exists only once `revealed`,
            and nothing after that edits it.
