/**
 * A focus track's study screen — one view, parameterised by track.
 *
 * Deliberately not `Samuel.tsx`. Everything specific to a track is data in
 * data/tracks.ts (name, books, default test date, blurb); this file knows only
 * that a track has some books and a date, so a second track is a new entry in
 * `TRACKS` and no code change at all.
 *
 * It is a near-twin of Daily Review, and that is the point rather than an
 * accident: "similar style, just a separate group" was the request, so the
 * session flow, the grading, the requeue policy and the summary screen are
 * Review's, mirrored step for step. Where it diverges it does so on purpose,
 * and each divergence is commented below. There are four:
 *
 *   1. **Scope is the track's books**, fixed, and the study plan does not
 *      filter it. A track is not a phase of the plan — it is a parallel course
 *      with its own deadline — so `followPlan` has no vote here.
 *   2. **No widening.** Review rescues an empty queue by dropping the plan
 *      filter and drawing from the whole bank, because a calendar may reorder
 *      your study but not cancel it. That rescue is wrong here: widening a
 *      Samuel session into Revelation is not a rescue, it is the wrong deck.
 *      An exhausted track says so and sends you away.
 *   3. **Grading clamps against the track's test date**, not the survey's — see
 *      `handleGrade`. This is the whole reason a track is more than a filter.
 *   4. **A fourth plate**, mastery across the track, because a track is small
 *      enough that "how much of this do I actually know?" is a question with a
 *      useful answer. Over six thousand items it is not.
 *
 * Card state is **shared** with the survey, on purpose. A 1 Samuel card studied
 * here is the same card as in Daily Review, with one schedule and one history:
 * `cards` is keyed by item id and this view scopes which ids a session draws
 * from, it does not copy them. Duplicating would give the same fact two
 * schedules that disagree, and count it twice in every mastery figure in the
 * app. The visible consequence is intended — work done here shortens tomorrow's
 * daily review, and vice versa.
