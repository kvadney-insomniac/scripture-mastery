/*
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Scoped option pools (#40)
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * Difficulty used to bite on roughly a third of the bank: the questions routed
 * through `distractorSets` carried easy and hard alternates, and everything
 * else fell back to one canon-wide `pickDistractors` draw at every setting.
 * That is why "hard" did not feel hard — a question about Leviticus would
 * happily offer Philemon, which is not a harder question, just a different
 * subject you can rule out without knowing anything.
 *
 * The helpers below give every remaining family the same shape the existing
 * ones already have: `hard` is a chain of pool builders ordered tightest-first
 * that `layeredPool` widens through only when the tight pool cannot fill a
 * six-choice card, and `easy` is the widest pool available, because the point
 * of easy is wrong options that are wrong on sight.
 *
 * `medium` is never touched. It is what lands in `Item.distractors`, which
 * validate.ts, the content-contract spec and every card rendered at the default
 * setting read, so each call below passes the *identical* pool expression and
 * seed the generator used before, and `scopedSets` reproduces the old value
 * exactly.
 */

/**

 * Book-order questions are the one family where the Testament seam is the wrong

 * makes these hard is proximity in the running order: Ezra against Nehemiah,
 * Esther and Chronicles is a question; Ezra against Matthew is a free point.
 * Hence `neighborBooks`/`distantBooks`, which cross the seam on purpose (#40).
 *
 * Two further notes on the medium set:
 *
 *  - The subject book was showing up as a wrong option on its own question —
 *    "Which book immediately precedes Leviticus?" offered Leviticus, because
 *    `pickDistractors` only excludes the *answer*. It has to come out of every
 *    pool, medium included.
 *  - It cannot come out of the medium *pool*, though. `seededShuffle` is a
 *    function of the array handed to it, so dropping one of 66 names reshuffles
 *    all 130 book-order cards — including the four-option Genesis card the
 *    content contract pins. So medium draws one extra and drops the subject
 *    after the fact: the 124 cards that never had the bug keep their exact
