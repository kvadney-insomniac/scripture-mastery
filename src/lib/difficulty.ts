/**
 * What each difficulty setting actually changes.
 *
 * Before this file the setting had two effects: it swapped the wrong-option set
 * on the ~30% of items that carried alternates, and it leaned the review queue
 * by ease. Everything else — how many options a question offers, whether it
 * asks for free recall first, and the order new material is introduced in —
 * was identical at all three settings, which is why `hard` did not feel hard
 * and `easy` did not feel easy.
 *
 * The rule that governs every dial below: **the item bank stays
 * difficulty-blind**. Item ids are the key SRS history is stored under, so a
 * bank that generated different items per setting would detach every card the
 * moment someone touched the control. Difficulty therefore lives entirely in
 * (a) which of an item's pre-baked option sets is rendered, (b) how much of it
 * is rendered, and (c) which cards get selected and in what order.
