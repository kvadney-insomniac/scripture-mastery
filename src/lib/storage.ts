   * today inside week 1 forever, so the plan could never advance past Phase 1.
   * A schedule is only meaningful relative to a fixed origin, so the origin has
   * to be a stored fact rather than a re-derived one.
   *
   * Unlike `difficulty` and `followPlan`, the sensible default is not a
   * constant: it is "when this member actually started", which is only knowable
   * per-store. So the default here is the empty sentinel and the real answer is
   * derived by `planStartOf` in store-ops.ts, which reads the review log. The
   * spread-under-defaults in both hooks still applies — a store written before
   * this key resolves to `''` rather than `undefined`, which keeps Settings
   * complete for every reader and puts the "not recorded" case in one shape
   * instead of two.

  /**
   * Per-focus-track quiz dates, keyed by track id — `{}` for an account that
   * has never moved one.
   *
   * A focus track is a separate course with a separate test (see
   * data/tracks.ts), so it cannot share `examDate`: the survey is scheduled
   * against one date and a Samuel test against another, and a single field
   * would make setting either one wrong the other. Keyed rather than a second
   * flat date because tracks are data — a second track is a new entry in
   * `TRACKS`, and it must not also be a new key here.
   *
   * The default is the empty map, not a map pre-filled from `TRACKS`. Same
   * reasoning as `planStart`: the honest default is not a constant this file
   * can name, it is the track's own `defaultExam`, and a copy of that value
   * sitting in every store would go stale the moment the track's date was
   * corrected. So the map holds only what the member has actually chosen, and
   * `trackExamOf` in store-ops.ts resolves the rest — including a hand-edited
   * or unparseable entry, which falls back rather than poisoning the clamp.
   *
   * Back-compatibility is the usual one: both hooks and `importStore` spread
   * `DEFAULT_SETTINGS` underneath the saved settings, so a store written before
   * this key reads as `{}` rather than `undefined` and every reader still gets
   * a complete Settings.
