 * stay byte-identical because SRS history is keyed on them, so a bank that
 * varied with the setting would detach every card the moment someone touched
 * the control. Generation stays difficulty-blind; only the render site chooses.
 *
 * The `medium` set is whatever the app produced before this file existed, and
 * it is still what lands in `Item.distractors`, so every existing reader —
 * validate.ts, the content-contract tests, the quiz results table — is
