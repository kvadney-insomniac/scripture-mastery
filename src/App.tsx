 * one-file change in data/tracks.ts: this list feeds the nav, the hash
 * validation and `<main aria-label>` alike, and none of them names a track.
 *
 * Tracks come last on purpose. The survey is the app; a track is a temporary
 * course bolted alongside it for one test, and putting it before Settings would
 * claim a permanence it does not have.
 *
 * A track id therefore shares a namespace with the tab ids above, and a
 * collision would shadow a whole view — `trackById` is only consulted once the
 * built-in tabs have had their turn below. There is no clash today and the ids
 * above are a closed set of seven words, so this is a note rather than a guard.
 *
 * `TabId` is a plain string rather than the union `TABS` could give, because
 * half of this list now comes from runtime data and a literal union cannot
 * absorb that. Membership is checked in `currentHash`, which is the only place
 * an unvalidated value ever enters.

        region. It names the tab, matching the nav item that was just pressed.

        The `<h1>` is the document's one and only, and it names the app rather
        than the view. Every view opens at `<h2>`, which left the outline with
        no top at all — a screen reader's heading list started midway down.
        Naming the *app* here is both the conventional shape (h1 the place, h2
        the section) and the only one that is safe from the shell: an h1 that
        repeated the view's name would sit alongside the view's own `<h2>`
        saying the same words, and the views are a shared surface this change
        has no business restructuring.

        Visually hidden, not decorative — the header already prints the app
        name and the nav already marks the current tab, so a third visible copy
        would be noise to everyone who can see the other two.
